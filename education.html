  The picture above is one of the memories I have when I was 6 years old and studying at TABIKA KEMAS Parit Baru which is a kindergarten. Although the picture is the official picture of my graduation from kindergarten, but I still remember my memory of studying there and that place was the first place I studied and started studying ABC, 123, and Alif Ba Ta. Not only that, kindergarten was also where I met my friends for the first time and got to know the teacher who was the first teacher to teach me. For me, this kindergarten is where I started to learn and get to know everything . TABIKA KEMAS Parit Baru is still in my memory&#128151; .

  <P>From 2008 to 2013, I continued my studies at my first primary school, Sekolah Kebangsaan Parit Baru. Here, I started learning a wide range of knowledge and a wide range of subjects, and of course, when I was in grade 1 i.e. 7 years old, I often cried because I was not familiar with the school environment&#128514;. But, day by day, I became more familiar with the school environment and I got to know more and more friends at that time.</p>

    <p>Apart from that, in the same year I studied at Sekolah Kebangsaan Parit Baru, I also studied at Sekolah Rendah Agama Parit Baru. But, I studied at the school in the afternoon session which started from 2.30 pm to 6 pm which is about 4 hours only. Although this afternoon’s school session was a bit short a variety of subjects about religion I studied. Among the subjects that I remember are Arabic, Tajwid, Akhlak, Imlak, Tauhid, Jawi & Khat, Hafazan and Sirah. For me, schooling in this afternoon session is really important because I will learn religious knowledge which is important knowledge in life. Although a bit tiring but it was fun because I studied with friends and in a comfortable environment.</p>

    <p>After finishing primary school, I continued to high school at Sekolah Agama Menengah Parit Baru. Here, I study a subject more extensively and it is definitely quite difficult. Starting this high school session, it was very tiring because school work was quite a lot for me and more difficult &#128514; &#128517;. But what is important is that when starting this high school, I have learned how to manage time properly due to the limited time to complete school work. Among the subjects that are quite difficult in school is definitely Mathematics and my favorite is Malay Language</p>

I have been continuing my studies in the Information Management Course (IM110) for about 3 years. As long as I studied at UiTM, it was a lot of fun because I met many new friends and it was the first time I was away from my family &#128534;. This Information Management course broadened my knowledge as I studied information such as records management, library management, and content management. Various knowledge that I gained while studying there and not only knowledge but I also gained experience away from family.</p>
