        <p>
        In 2019, I used to be a teacher in kindergarten but only for a short time, that is for about 5 months. It was my first temporary work experience where it gave me many sweet memories. I decided to work at an Al Faqeh Kidz Kindergarten, Sungai Buloh, Selangor because at that time I had a long free time before I decided to continue studying at Universiti Teknologi Mara Rembau Campus. So, at the end of 2018, I had joined the interview as a teacher, and thanks to the beginning of 2019, I was accepted to work. At that time, there was no word other than gratitude to Allah&#128151; for giving me the opportunity to gain experience

        These picture and videos are among my memories of the kindergarten students I used to teach. Among my experiences teaching them is that it is not something easy because this kindergarten is like their first school where they start learning the basics here. So, to give that understanding is an effort that needs to be increased because sometimes these kindergarten students are less focused&#128514; but they remain enthusiastic

        There is also experience with a colleague who is also a teacher. They are also like teachers to me because they share a lot about how to teach properly and interestingly. They also often shared their experiences throughout the teaching and of course it gave me knowledge to me at that time.

        While the country was being hit by the Coronavirus or Covid-19 outbreak, the Movement Control Order (MCO) was fully implemented and at that time I was definitely not able to do my daily activities independently. Still, day after day the MCO was loosened up and at that point me and my family members were planning to cycle together. At first it was a bit awkward as I rarely cycled &#129315; but day by day we are used to it. Me and some of my family members cycled a maximum of 20 kilometers only to comply with the set MCO.

        My experience while cycling was very enjoyable although a bit tiring due to not being used to doing this activity. What is most tiring is when pedaling high up that is the hill because it has to use more energy, otherwise I will definitely fall &#129319 ;. Luckily back then I brought a plentiful supply of water so it was more spirited when paddling. Also, while cycling I was also chased by dogs &#128557; &#128557; &#128557; and I think it was my bad experience cycling because at that time I was very scared and anxious moreover I was very tired at that time &#128565; but I also try to pedal faster. I was lucky that no injuries occurred and all of a sudden the fear of cycling &#128555;
